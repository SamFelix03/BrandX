# WebSearch Agent

## Overview

The **WebSearch Agent** combines the power of **ASI:One AI** and **Exa Research tool** to provide comprehensive, real-time information about brands, companies, products, and topics. The agent intelligently decides when to perform web research versus answering queries directly using general knowledge.

### Key Features
- **Intelligent Decision Making**: Automatically determines when web research is needed
- **Comprehensive Research**: Uses Exa API for deep, multi-source research
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Leverages ASI:One for intelligent reasoning and response generation
- **REST API**: Provides HTTP endpoints for external integration
- **Real-time Communication**: Supports both chat protocols and REST API
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Handles long-running research tasks efficiently

**Decision Criteria**:
- **USE RESEARCH** when:
  - Querying specific brands, companies, or products
  - Asking for recent news or developments
  - Requesting comprehensive analysis
  - Seeking information about controversies or market trends
  - Asking "what's happening with" or "latest news about"

### 3. Exa Research API

## Workflow Process

### 1. Query Reception
```
User Query ‚Üí ASI:One AI ‚Üí Decision Analysis
```

### 2. Decision Making
ASI:One analyzes the query and determines if web research is needed based on:
- Information recency requirements
- Specific entity mentions
- Research depth requests
- Time-sensitive indicators

### 3. Research Execution (if needed)
```
ASI:One ‚Üí Exa API ‚Üí Research Initiation ‚Üí Polling ‚Üí Results
```

### 4. Response Generation
```
Research Results ‚Üí ASI:One ‚Üí Final Response ‚Üí User
```

### Detailed Workflow

1. **Query Analysis**
   - User sends query via chat or REST API
   - ASI:One receives query with system prompt
   - AI analyzes query characteristics

2. **Tool Decision**
   - ASI:One evaluates if `exa_search` tool should be used
   - Decision based on intelligent reasoning criteria
   - Tool choice set to "auto" for autonomous decision

3. **Research Execution** (if tool is called)
   - Exa API receives comprehensive research instructions
   - Research ID returned for tracking
   - Agent polls for completion status
   - Results retrieved when research completes

4. **Response Synthesis**
   - Research results fed back to ASI:One
   - AI generates comprehensive response
   - Response includes citations and sources
   - Final response sent to user
