## Core Components

### Agent Configuration
```python
agent = Agent(
    name="brandx_negative_reddit_search_agent",
    port=8080,  # Unique port for Reddit operations
    seed="brandx negative reddit search agent seed",
    mailbox=True,
    endpoint=["http://localhost:8080/submit"]
)
```

### RedditSearchAgent Class

**Primary Engine** for Reddit post analysis:

```python
class RedditSearchAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.reddit_endpoint = REDDIT_MCP_ENDPOINT
```

**Key Methods:**
- `search_reddit_posts(product_name, sentiment="negative")`: Executes Reddit search via MCP server
- `create_reddit_tool_schema()`: Defines tool schema for ASI:One integration
- `process_reddit_query(user_query)`: Main processing pipeline with AI intelligence

**Unique Features:**
- **Cloud Endpoint**: Uses Google Cloud Run Reddit MCP service
- **Single Paragraph Output**: Formats responses as concise summaries
- **Reddit-Only Focus**: Exclusively searches Reddit communities

### Data Models

**Request Model:**
```python
class RedditNegativeRequest(Model):
    product_name: str
    sentiment: str = "negative"  # Default to negative Reddit posts
```

**Response Model:**
```python
class RedditNegativeResponse(Model):
    success: bool
    product_name: str
    sentiment: str
    reddit_result: str
    timestamp: str
    agent_address: str
```

## Intelligent Query Processing

### ASI:One Integration

The agent uses **ASI:One's asi1-mini and asi1-extended models** for intelligent decision making:

**Decision Criteria:**
1. **Reddit Post Requests**: Does the query ask for Reddit posts, discussions, or threads?
2. **Product/Brand Focus**: Is the query about specific products, brands, or companies?
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Are they looking for negative Reddit posts or discussions?
4. **Community Research**: Do they want Reddit community sentiment insights?

**Tool Usage Triggers (USE TOOL):**
- "Find negative Reddit posts for iPhone"
- "What do Reddit users discuss about Tesla?"
- "Show me Reddit threads about Nike products"
- "Reddit discussions for Starbucks"
- "What problems do Reddit users report with [product]?"

    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

**Model Usage:**
- **Initial Decision**: `asi1-mini` for efficient query analysis
- **Final Processing**: `asi1-extended` for comprehensive response generation

### Reddit MCP Server Integration
**Endpoint**: `https://redditmcp-739298578243.us-central1.run.app/scrape-reddit-posts`

## Workflow Process

### Complete Request Flow

1. **Query Reception**
   - Receives user query via chat or REST API
   - Extracts text content and validates structure

2. **Intelligence Processing**
   - **ASI:One asi1-mini** analyzes query for Reddit-related intent
   - Decides whether to use Reddit search tool or respond directly
   - Applies Reddit-specific decision criteria

3. **Reddit Search** (if tool is used)
   - Extracts product name and sentiment from tool call
   - Sends POST request to cloud Reddit MCP server
   - Processes Reddit community data and discussions

4. **Response Generation**
   - **ASI:One asi1-extended** formats results into single paragraph
   - Summarizes all negative Reddit content cohesively
   - Returns streamlined response without formatting

### Example Flow
**Input**: "What do Reddit users complain about regarding AirPods?"
**Process**: Query Analysis â†’ Tool Usage Decision â†’ Cloud MCP Call â†’ Paragraph Generation
**Output**: Single paragraph summarizing all negative Reddit discussions

## Response Examples

### Successful Response Format
```
Reddit users frequently express frustration with Tesla Model 3's build quality issues, particularly panel gaps and paint defects that many owners discover immediately after delivery, while numerous posts in r/teslamotors and r/electricvehicles detail problems with the car's touchscreen freezing and requiring hard resets, alongside widespread complaints about Tesla's customer service being unresponsive and service appointments taking weeks to schedule, with many users also reporting issues with the car's autopilot system making sudden unexpected movements that feel unsafe, and concerns about the vehicle's range being significantly lower than advertised especially in cold weather conditions.
```

### Error Response

{
  "success": false,
  "product_name": "InvalidProduct",
