## Agent-to-Agent Communication

### **Automatic Bounty Generation**

The bounty agent operates in two modes:

#### **Auto-Generation Mode**
1. **Metrics Reception**: Receives brand data from metrics agent via A2A communication
2. **Immediate Processing**: Automatically triggers bounty generation upon data receipt
3. **Storage**: Saves generated bounties for later retrieval
4. **Acknowledgment**: Sends confirmation back to metrics agent

#### **Manual Generation Mode**
1. **REST API Requests**: Handles direct bounty generation requests
2. **Chat Protocol**: Processes natural language bounty requests
3. **Data Fetching**: Retrieves brand data from knowledge graph if needed
4. **Response Delivery**: Returns structured bounty suggestions
